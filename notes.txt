DEETS_POTLUCK
I tried to make it only show items belonging to that potluck but the while loop wont work. this is what i am trying to say:
<!--        <% whle item.potluck.id %> == <% potluck.id %> -->

<!--Can we use the same form? Can't we change on the
  models page that if the items are new, make an item,
  if they are updating, then make an item?
  This is used for saving edit:
  <form method="post" action="/save_item/<%= @item.id %>">
-->
<!--Pushing this button needs to add a new item to the potluck connecting them
  through the database-->


  Maybe we can use something like: <%= "checked" if @item.tags.include?(tag)
